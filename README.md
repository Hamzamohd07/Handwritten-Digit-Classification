## Handwritten Digit Classification Using ANN

**Objective:** 



This project aims to develop an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to classify handwritten digits (0-9) using the MNIST dataset.

**Data Preprocessing:** The MNIST dataset, consisting of 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images of 28x28 pixel grayscale digits, will be loaded, normalized, and converted to one-hot encoded labels.

**Model Design:** The neural network will include an input layer with 784 neurons, one or more dense hidden layers with ReLU activation functions, and an output layer with 10 neurons using softmax activation to classify the digits.

**Training:** The model will be trained using categorical cross-entropy as the loss function and optimizers like Adam or SGD. Training parameters such as epochs and batch size will be optimized for best performance.

**Evaluation:** The model's accuracy will be evaluated on the test dataset. A confusion matrix will be generated, and performance metrics like precision and recall will be calculated to assess the model's effectiveness.

**Tools:** The project will utilize Python with libraries such as TensorFlow/Keras, NumPy, and Matplotlib, focusing on the MNIST dataset for training and evaluation.

**Outcome:** The expected result is a highly accurate ANN model for digit classification, accompanied by a report detailing the design, training, and evaluation process.
